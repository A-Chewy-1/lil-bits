Welcome to the Bitcoin Cash Community - a place to discuss and promote Bitcoin Cash.

We are glad you've chosen low fees and fast speeds!

A few things to note before you start chatting:

* While we do not advocate censorship, this is not an advertising platform. **Please do not spam our chat with links**. We will remove unapproved links and throw down ban hammers if needed.
* If you have a BCH project you would like to promote to the community, please message @blake#2912 who will be happy to chat about it.
* **We are a BCH community, not a place for BTC promoters or trolls.** If you see any in the chat feel free to message our mods with the tag @moderators and they'll resolve any issues.
* Keep conversation to the right channel (see the channel description at the top if you arenâ€™t sure what this is).

*Oh, and Shilly occasionally runs a BCH raffle for online users, so itâ€™s worthwhile having the app open. ðŸ˜‰*
